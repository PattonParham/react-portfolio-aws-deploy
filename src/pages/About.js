            <div className="abouttext">
            Having a background in technological science with a BS 
in Audio Engineering from Belmont University (Honors Program), 
I decided to further my passion and career by learning 
how to code and becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer through Vanderbilt's
Coding Bootcamp Program. I particularly enjoy the 
creativity and logic-puzzle solving involved in the process of
developing a website or application. It is my highest objective to 
bring my enthusiasm for technology, innovation and creation into a 
full-time position.
